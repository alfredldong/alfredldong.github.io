**Figure.** Topological phase transition. a, Six objects of different geometries can be grouped into three pairs of topologies. Each pair has the same topological invariant, known as its genus. b, Two waveguides formed by mirrors of different (right) and same (left) topologies. c, Frequency bands of different topologies cannot transition into each other without closing the frequency gap. A topological phase transition takes place on the right, but not on the left. d, Interfacial states have different connectivity with the bulk bands, depending on the band topologies of the bulk mirrors. Here, a is the period of the waveguide propagating along $y$, and $\Delta C$ is the change in Chern number between the corresponding bulk bands on the right and left of the waveguide. The magnitude of $\Delta C$ equals the number of gapless interfacial modes and the sign of $\Delta C$ indicates the direction of propagation.

**Euler示性数**

$$\chi=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_SK\mathrm{d}A$$

其中$K$表示Gaussian曲率

很容易检验$\chi=2$对于一个半径为$R$的球, 当$K=1/R^2$.

Euler示性数和亏格之间的关系：$\chi=2−2g$
